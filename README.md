# VAT Clustering Algorithm 🚀

## 📌 Overview
This package provides an implementation of the **Visual Assessment of Cluster Tendency (VAT) Algorithm**, allowing users to **analyze dataset clusterability before applying clustering techniques.**  

## ⚡ Features
✔ Implements the **Prim’s-based VAT Algorithm**  
✔ Generates **VAT-reordered dissimilarity matrices**  
✔ Provides **optimized VAT using Numba for faster performance**  
✔ Provides **optimized VAT using CYTHON for Even faster performance**  

##📊 Datasets Used
We tested our implementation on the following datasets:

Iris

Spotify subset (500x500)

Mall Customers

Blobs

Circles

Gaussian Mixture

Moons

All datasets are stored as .npy dissimilarity matrices under /data.


## 📥 Installation
```bash
pip install -e .
